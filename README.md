#. 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Task

```
The marketing agency Horiseon requested a codebase that 
follows accessibility standards to ensure there site is optimized for search engines.
```

## Adjustments Made

```
The webpage meets accessibility standards..
- WHEN you view the source code
- THEN you find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN you view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN you find that the elements follow a logical structure independent    of styling and positioning

- WHEN you view the image elements
- THEN you find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN you view the heading attributes
- They fall in sequential order
- WHEN you view the title element
- THEN you find a concise, descriptive title
```
## Closing
